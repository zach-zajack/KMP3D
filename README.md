# KMP3D
KMP3D is a [Google SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/) plugin that functions as a 3D interface for [Mario Kart Wii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_Wii)'s [KMP](http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/KMP) files, which deal with coordinate information, such as checkpoints, item routes, or respawn positions. Points are represented using spheres and vectors, depending on the point type.
